# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room – Excel Dashboard Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **Excel Dashboard** created to analyze a hospital’s **Emergency Room (ER)** performance.  
The dashboard provides valuable insights into **patients, wait times, satisfaction scores, demographics, and referrals**, helping hospital administrators and healthcare professionals make **data-driven decisions**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To analyze ER performance and identify **patterns in patient flow**.  
- To explore how patients are distributed by **age, gender, satisfaction, and referrals**.  
- To highlight **waiting time and attendance trends** for better resource allocation.  
- To provide decision-makers with a **clear, interactive summary** instead of raw hospital logs.  

---

## 🚩 Business Problem  
Hospitals often struggle with:  
- Long **wait times** that reduce patient satisfaction.  
- Lack of clarity on **which age groups and demographics dominate ER visits**.  
- Inefficient tracking of **referrals to different departments**.  

Without visualization, analysis of hospital records becomes **slow, error-prone, and reactive**.  

---

## ✅ How the Dashboard Solves This  
The Excel dashboard solves the above challenges by:  
- Offering a **monthly overview** of patient count, wait times, and satisfaction.  
- Allowing users to **drill down** (via hyperlinks) into detailed reports.  
- Highlighting **trends in attendance, referrals, and demographics**.  
- Enabling **interactive filtering** with slicers.  

This transforms raw hospital data into **actionable insights** for healthcare planning and resource management.

## ⚡ Features  
- 📌 **KPIs at a glance:** Total patients, average wait time, satisfaction score, admitted vs non-admitted.  
- 📊 **Distribution Analysis:** Age, gender, department referrals, and attendance status.  
- 🎛 **Interactivity:** Slicers for month, year, and patient dimensions.  
- 🏥 **Drill-through Navigation:** Implemented using **Excel hyperlinks** to simulate Power BI-style interactivity.  
- 🎨 **Engaging Visuals:** Area charts, bar charts, donut charts, treemaps, and KPIs.
